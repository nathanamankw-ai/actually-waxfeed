# WAXFEED ECONOMY v2: FIRST SPIN

## The Zero-to-One Insight

Most people think music opinions are worthless unless you're a paid critic.

**The contrarian truth**: Your taste has REAL value—but only if you can PROVE you had it BEFORE everyone else.

Every music fan has said "I liked them before they were cool." But there's no way to prove it.

Until now.

---

## THE CONCEPT: FIRST SPIN

**One simple mechanic**: When you review an album, you're going ON RECORD.

If that album later trends (gets 100+ reviews, hits Hot Takes, charts on Billboard), everyone who reviewed it EARLY gets rewarded retroactively.

It's like:
- Calling a stock before it moons
- Predicting the Super Bowl winner
- Saying "remember when I told you about this band?"

**You're betting on your own taste.**

---

## WHY IT'S IMMEDIATELY VALUABLE

No complex point systems. No confusing spend/earn loops.

**When you write a review, you instantly understand**:
- "I'm the 3rd person to review this album on Waxfeed"
- "If this blows up, I was EARLY"
- "My taste is now ON RECORD, timestamped, provable"

---

## THE MECHANICS

### FIRST SPIN BADGES

When you're among the first 10, 50, or 100 reviewers of an album that later trends:

| Badge | Requirement | Wax Reward |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **GOLD SPIN** | First 10 reviewers | 100 Wax |
| **SILVER SPIN** | First 50 reviewers | 50 Wax |
| **BRONZE SPIN** | First 100 reviewers | 25 Wax |

Badges appear on your profile forever. They're PROOF you called it early.

### WHAT TRIGGERS A "TREND"?

An album is "trending" when it hits any of:
- 100+ reviews on Waxfeed
- Featured in Hot Takes
- Enters Billboard 200
- 10,000+ monthly Spotify listeners (for new artists)

**The algorithm checks retroactively**. You might review an album today, forget about it, and get a notification 3 months later: "Your review of [Album] just earned you a GOLD SPIN—you were reviewer #7!"

---

## TASTEMAKER SCORE

Your aggregate measure of predictive taste:

```
TASTEMAKER SCORE = (Gold Spins × 10) + (Silver Spins × 5) + (Bronze Spins × 2)
```

This score:
- Appears on your profile
- Ranks you on leaderboards
- Proves your credibility

A score of 50+ means you've correctly predicted multiple trends.
A score of 200+ means you have genuinely elite taste.

## WAX: SIMPLE AND CLEAR

**What is Wax?**
Social currency that proves your taste has value.

**How do you GET Wax?**
1. **Early reviews pay off**: First Spin badges award Wax retroactively
2. **Daily review**: +5 Wax for reviewing every day (habit formation)
3. **Community recognition**: Others award you Wax for great reviews

**What do you DO with Wax?**
1. **Tip great reviewers**: Award Wax to reviews you respect
2. **Boost your reviews**: Spend Wax to feature your review
3. **Unlock badges/frames**: Customize your profile

**Why buy Wax?**
- More Wax to tip = more visibility for your favorites
- More boosts = more exposure for YOUR takes
- It's like buying Super Likes on Tinder—limited but powerful

## THE VIRAL LOOP

1. **DJ reviews album** → Gets First Spin position noted
2. **Album trends** → DJ gets Gold Spin badge + Wax
3. **DJ posts badge to Twitter** → "Just got my 5th Gold Spin 🔥"
4. **Music Twitter sees** → "What's a Gold Spin?"
5. **They sign up** → To prove THEIR taste
6. **They review albums** → Loop continues

The badge IS the flex. The Tastemaker Score IS the credential.

---

2. **Free Station Plan**: 6 months free, no strings

4. **Press**: "College Radio Returns—Now With Proof"

Once 50 stations are active:

---

## WHY THIS IS 0-TO-1

**What nobody else does**:
- RateYourMusic: Reviews have no temporal value
- Letterboxd: No "early reviewer" mechanic
- Spotify: Algorithm-driven, not taste-driven
- Twitter: Opinions are ephemeral, not timestamped

**What Waxfeed does**:
- **Timestamps your taste**
- **Rewards being right**
- **Creates provable credentials**
- **Makes discovery a game**

---

## THE EMOTION

When you write a review on Waxfeed, you feel:

1. **Anticipation**: "Will this album blow up? I'm betting it will."
2. **Ownership**: "I'm on record. This is MY call."
3. **Validation**: (3 months later) "I CALLED IT. Gold Spin."
4. **Status**: "My Tastemaker Score is 127. What's yours?"

This is NOT:
- Confusing point systems
- Complicated earning caps
- Subscription-gated features

This IS:
- One clear mechanic (be early, get credit)
- One clear emotion (prove your taste)
- One clear metric (Tastemaker Score)

---
